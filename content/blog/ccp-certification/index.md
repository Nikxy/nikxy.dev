Hello y'all!  
I'm really interested in working as a DevOps Engineer, and for the last year I have been learning all the ins and outs of this role.  
While I have experience with software development and working with servers, I have never worked with cloud services.  
So a few months ago I decided to pursue the AWS DevOps Professional Certificate. As I had almost zero experience with AWS I went first with the Cloud Practitioner certification.

## Resources

I used only free resources starting with AWS's Skill Builder courses:
- [Cloud Essentials - Knowledge Badge Readiness Path](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/public/learning_plan/view/82/cloud-essentials-knowledge-badge-readiness-path)
- [Exam Prep Standard Course: AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/external/view/elearning/16434/exam-prep-standard-course-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-clf-c02-english)

After finishing the courses I did a few practice exams I found with free coupons for Udemy on [r/udemyfreebies](https://www.reddit.com/r/udemyfreebies/), after each exam I went through the wrong answers and researched what was the right answer and why.

After some practice exams when I got a consistent passing score and felt confident enough, I scheduled an online exam.

## Conclusion
The exam was pretty easy and I recommend it for anyone working with AWS to learn the basics and services AWS has to offer.  
It took me about two weeks of on-off evenings learning while having a full time job.
